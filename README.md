======  Data storage in SUPABASE with tables  ======

=== Overciew of Supabase === 
In Supabase, data is stored using tables within the project's database. For the Hospital Management System, the following key tables are used:

=> Patients Table: 
This table stores information about patients, including personal details such as name, email, contact number, date of birth, medical history, and the date the record was created.

=> Doctors Table: 
This table holds details about the doctors, such as their name, email, specialization, contact number, and the date of record creation.

=> Appointments Table:
This table tracks patient appointments, including the patient ID, doctor ID, appointment date and time, and appointment status (e.g., scheduled, completed, canceled).

Additionally, Supabase provides a storage bucket that is used to manage and store images (such as profile pictures of doctors and patients), allowing easy retrieval via public URLs.
These tables and storage buckets are integrated with the Hospital Management System, enabling seamless management of hospital data and resources through the Supabase backend.

Create a Supabase Account and Project

Sign Up/Login to Supabase:
1. Go to Supabase.
2. Sign up or log in if you already have an account.

Create a New Project:
1. Once logged in, click on "New Project".
2. Fill in the required details:
   2.1 Project Name: Choose a name for your project.
   2.2 Password: Set a strong password.
   2.3 Region: Choose the region closest to your location.
3. Click "Create Project".

   Obtain API Credentials:
1. After your project is created, go to Project Settings > API to get your Supabase URL and anon key. These will be used in your application to connect to Supabase.
2. Here we can create a .env file in our project
   2.1 VITE_SUPABASE_URL (this for react-vite  app)
   2.2 VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (same as above)
3. The above 2.1 and 2.2 we can get from supabase with the access the table ect.

=>  Set Up Supabase Database Tables

*** You’ll need to create three tables: patients, doctors, and appointments, as well as a bucket for image storage. 

I. Create the Patients Table
1. Go to the Table Editor in Supabase and create a new table called patients.
2. Define the following columns:
   2.1. id (UUID, Primary Key): Unique identifier for each patient.
   2.2. name (Text): Name of the patient.
   2.3. email (Text): Email address of the patient.
   2.4. dob (Date): Date of birth.
   2.5. contact_number (Text): Contact number.
   2.6. medical_history (Text): A field to store the patient’s medical history.
   2.7. created_at (Timestamp): Automatically generated timestamp when the record is created.
3. The above (2) are Example  for create a table and we can add the columns what ever we want.

II. Same for the Doctor Table.
III. same for the Appointments.


======  Install Supabase in Your Project  ======

Install the Supabase Client in your project:
  1. npm install @supabase/supabase-js

Initialize Supabase in your React Application:
1. Create a .env file in your project root directory to store your Supabase credentials:
   1.1 REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   1.2 REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

In your React application, create a file to initialize Supabase:

{ import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseKey = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);

export default supabase; }


======  Conclusion  ======
 
By following these steps,I have successfully integrated Supabase into your Hospital Management System. Supabase handles user authentication, database management for patients, doctors, and appointments, and image storage, allowing for a seamless backend experience.

Feel free to adjust the integration to match the specific requirements of your project, such as adding additional functionality or customizing the data flow.
